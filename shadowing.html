<!-- what is Shadowing? 

1) Block Scoping:

To understand shadowing in JavaScript, we need
to be clear with the scope first. In computer programming languages, Scope is a
certain section/region of the program where a defined variable can have its
existence and can be recognized, beyond that it can’t be accessed. 

Block is a compound statement that is defined by curly braces {} and used to combine
multiple statements into one statement where JavaScript expects only one
statement. And all the variables and functions that can be accessed inside a
block are said to be inside that block scope, hence called Block scoped. 

let and const variables are stored in separate memory space, so it is called block-scoped 
but var variables can be accessed outside the block as it is stored in the Global object memory space,
hence it is called Global scoped.

2) Shadowing:

when a variable is declared in a certain scope having the same name defined on its outer scope 
and when we call the variable from the inner scope, the value assigned to the variable in the inner scope
is the value that will be stored in the variable in the memory space. This is known as Shadowing or Variable Shadowing.

Example:

var msg = 'Hello ';
var name = 'John';
function greet(){
  var msg = 'Julia';
  if(true){
    console.log(msg + name); //Hello Julia
  }
}

greet();

3) Issues with var

Let us take an example:

var greetings = 'Hello John';

function greet() {
  console.log(greetings); // undefined
  if (true) {
    var greetings = 'Hello Julia';
    console.log(greetings); //Hello Julia
  }
  console.log(greetings); //Hello Julia
}

greet();

4) Hoisting

Where do you hoist a flag?

On the top of the castle.

Let us take an example to understand *hoisting* in JavaScript:

console.log(msg);
var msg = 'Hello World';

Output:

undefined

Wait…! I think we should get the following error because the variable msg was not declared when we tried to access it

Uncaught ReferenceError: msg is not defined

Well, in JavaScript, it does not matter where variables are declared within a particular scope. All variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope.

var msg;
console.log(msg);
msg = 'Hello World';

As we can see the variable declaration was hoisted at the top of the scope, global-scope in this case. But the variable assignment was NOT hoisted. The JavaScript interpreter assigned it the default value undefined. Hence we got the output undefined.

The same concept would apply with function scope (local scope). All variable declarations inside a function will be hoisted at the top of the function, no matter where they are declared in the function.

 function greet(){
  if(true){
    var msg = 'Hello World';
  }
  console.log(msg);
}

greet();
console.log(msg);

The above program was translated by JavaScript interpreter as if var msg was hoisted at the top of the function although it is declared inside the if block.

 function greet(){
  var msg;
  if(true){
    msg = 'Hello World';
  }
  console.log(msg);
}

greet();
console.log(msg);

5) Temporal Dead Zone explained

This is what the TDZ is: the term to describe the state where variables are un-reachable. They are in scope, but they aren't declared.

The let and const variables exist in the TDZ from the start of their enclosing scope until they are declared.

You could also say that the variables exist in the TDZ from the place they get bound (when the variable gets bound to the scope it's inside)
until it is declared (when a name is reserved in memory for that variable).

You can see above that if I accessed the age variable earlier than its declaration, it would throw a ReferenceError. Because of the TDZ.

But var won't do that. var is just default initialized to undefined unlike the other declaration
